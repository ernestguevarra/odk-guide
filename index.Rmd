# Introduction {-}

**Open Data Kit (ODK)** is a free and open-source set of tools which help organizations author, field, and manage mobile data collection solutions. **ODK** provides an out-of-the-box solution for users to:

* Build a data collection form or survey (**XLSForm** is recommended for larger forms);

* Collect the data on a mobile device and send it to a server; and

* Aggregate the collected data on a server and extract it in useful formats.
